# golang-volkswagen [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zackexplosion/golang-volkswagen.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/zackexplosion/golang-volkswagen)


golang-volkswagen detects when your tests are being run in a CI server, and makes them pass.

# Why?

If you want your software to be adopted by Americans, good tests scores from the CI server is very important. Volkswagen uses a defeat device to detect when it's being tested in a CI server and will automatically reduce errors to an acceptable level for the tests to pass. This will allow you to spend less time worrying about testing and more time enjoying the good life as a successful software developer.
